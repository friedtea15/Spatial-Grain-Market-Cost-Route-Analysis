# Spatial-Grain-Market-Cost-Route-Analysis

*This algorithm computes the optimized market for a given corn field location, route distance, and spot grain market bid price.* 

## About the Project
This program was developed for the project *Evolving Supply Chains and Local Freight Flows: A GIS Analysis of Minnesota Cereal Grain*. This study was a product of the Transportation Policy & Economic Competitiveness (TPEC) advisory board, housed in the Humphrey School for Public Affairs, University of Minnesota. The final analysis is published in the Transportation Research Board's (TRB) peer-revied, March 2018 journal. Presentations were also given at the 97th Annual TRB Meeting, the 59th Annual TRF Conference, and the Minnesota Grain & Feed Association Conference. 

Further information of the project can be found on the TPEC website: http://freighteconomyatlas.org/amber-roads-of-grain/
